/p{start} The Alan Parsons Project was conceived in 1975 as a collaboration between audio engineer and producer Alan Parsons—famous for his work on landmark albums like The Beatles’ Abbey Road and Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon—and songwriter/musician Eric Woolfson. Rather than a conventional touring band, the Project operated as a studio-based collective, drawing on a rotating roster of session musicians and vocalists to bring each album’s concept to life. Parsons’ meticulous approach to production and engineering—combined with Woolfson’s knack for crafting evocative melodies and narratives—yielded a series of polished, sonically adventurous records that blurred the lines between progressive rock, pop, and symphonic elements.

/p{end} Over the course of ten studio albums released between 1977 and 1987, The Alan Parsons Project explored wide-ranging themes—from the existential and technological speculations of I Robot (1977) to the introspective meditations on human perception in Eye in the Sky (1982). Tracks like “Eye in the Sky,” “Games People Play,” and “Time” became radio staples, showcasing the duo’s gift for marrying thought-provoking lyrics with lush arrangements. Although the Project never performed live in its original form, its albums have endured as touchstones of 1970s and ’80s art-rock, influencing generations of producers and musicians drawn to its blend of conceptual ambition and studio craftsmanship.
